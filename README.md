A tool for managing and modifying GTA SA audio archives with both **PC** and **PS2** in mind, its still on early steps and there is a lot to do and improve. but it works! you can export and create SFX archives and so much more...

## TODO
- [ ] clean up the code.
- [ ] change how we handle errors and make it more orginized.
- [ ] add support for managing streams.
- [ ] update bank slots after making changes to a SFX archive if needed.
- [x] improve the CLI interface and improve UX.
- [ ] in the end **MAYBE** write a gui.
- [ ] enable github action, for building the doc.
- [ ] better readme.
- [ ] You tell me!
